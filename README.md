Golf Simulator Control Box - Open Source Firmware
This repository contains the source code for my custom-built golf simulator control boxes. If you're building your own, this code provides the essential functionality to ensure seamless hotkey integration across various simulator software.

About
These control boxes are designed to be plug and play, working effortlessly with simulator software without additional setup. This repository contains the firmware and mappings necessary to make them function correctly.

Supported Features
Multi-layout support with a reversible cover plate

Bluetooth connectivity for wireless operation

Pre-programmed hotkeys for GSPRO, TGC2019, FSX Play, and SkyTrak CoursePlay

Rechargeable 18650 battery integration

No external software requiredâ€”one box controls them all

How to Use
Download the code and flash it onto your Arduino-based control box.

Ensure button mappings match the pre-configured hotkeys for your chosen simulator software.

Modify as needed to suit your personal setup!
